# WSEI_CS_Imperium

The game is intended to play in background when doing other things.
Your goal is to win versus the Other Imperium.

All you have to do is just clicking the "Zbieraj" button. 
With this button you can get resources to level up buildings and get more resources
When you are tired of clicking you can level up the "Automatyzacja" building - you will get resources after few secpnds

When you collect enough resources you can build the "Stocznia" to collect ships.
This ships will help you attack another civilisations.
Without them you cannot end the game.

When you are low on resources use your credits to buy some or buy ships.
Or if you are low on credits just sell some of resources.

It just that simple.
